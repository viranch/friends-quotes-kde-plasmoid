This is a KDE plasmoid that scrobbles through all the quotes
from the popular TV series Friends.
The list of these quotes is taken from:
http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friends_(TV_series)

It sits in your panel or on the desktop and switched through
quotes every 5 minutes.

=INSTALL=========

Make sure you are running the KDE SC version >= 4.8.
You would also require the 'zip' package installed.
(Test by simply running the 'zip' command on console)

Make and install the plasmoid package from source:

$ cd friends-quotes-kde-plasmoid/
$ sh install.sh

The plasmoid is now installed and can now be added to the desktop/panel
from the widgets list.

The source directory can also be safely deleted.
