This is a KDE plasmoid that scrobbles through all the quotes
from the popular TV series Friends.
The list of these quotes is taken from:
http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friends_(TV_series)

It sits in your panel or on the desktop and switched through
quotes every 5 minutes.

=INSTALL=========

Make sure you are running the KDE SC version >= 4.8.

One line install: (do this if you don't want to clone
the repository and directly install the plasmoid)
Copy-paste the following line on your console and run:

    wget -q https://github.com/viranch/friends-quotes-kde-plasmoid/tarball/master -O - | tar zx && cd viranch* && sh install.sh && cd ..

Alternate install: (you can do this if you want to or
have the repository cloned)

    $ cd friends-quotes-kde-plasmoid/
    $ sh install.sh

The plasmoid is now installed and can now be added to the desktop/panel
from the widgets list.

The repository directory can also be safely deleted.

=SOURCE DATA====

NOTE: This is only for information and reference and for
developers. You do not need to read/do this for installing
the plasmoid.

The complete list of quotes is taken from the above mentioned
link. There is a stripped and refined friends.html in root of
the repo. The applet uses the XML form of the file to show the
quotes. To generate the XML, simply run the script
generate_xml.sh placed inside the scripts/ directory:

$ cd scripts
$ sh generate_xml.sh

This will create a file friends.xml which is copied to the
contents/ui/ directory of the applet.
